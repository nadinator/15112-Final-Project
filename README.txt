This project was created at the very end of my first programming course at CMUQ, 
Fundamentals of Imperative programming (15-112) in the Fall of 2018.

It was an attempt at recreating the popular card game Yu-Gi-Oh, with a CMUQ twist.

The code is extremely janky and the design is all over the place, but it was a sincere
attempt at the game.


*** DESIGN NOTES ***

I decided to go with pygame for the GUI, although looking back that was highly unnecessary.
Tkinter was the obvious alternative.

The main game background, main menu, and instructions page were all created using Paint
and imported into the GUI as images. All cards were also images, edited using Paint to
display number values. 


*** EXECUTION NOTES ***

To play the game, simply run the NDO-GUI-VII.py file, and enjoy it for the buggy mess that it is!
